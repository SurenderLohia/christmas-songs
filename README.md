## [Joy to the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30OaM6b48k8)

Joy to the world! The Lord has come!  
Let earth receive her King;  
Let every heart prepare Him room,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.  

Joy to the Earth! The Saviour reigns!  
Let men their songs employ;  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.  


## [Jingle Bells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CWJNqyub3o)

Dashing through the snow,  
in a one-horse open sleigh.  
O 'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.  
Bells on bob-tails ring,  
making spirits bright.  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
a sleighing song tonight, hey 

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!  

A day or two ago  
The story I must tell  
I went out on the snow  
And on my back I fell  
A gent was riding by  
In a one-horse open sleigh  
He laughed as there I sprawling lie  
But quickly drove away 

Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh, hey  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one-horse open sleigh

We wish you a merry Christmas,  
We wish you a merry Christmas,  
We wish you a merry Christmas,  
and a happy New Year!

## [Silent Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEH7_2c644Q)

Silent night, holy night,  
all is calm, all is bright.  
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child,  
Holy infant so tender and mild.  
Sleep in heavenly peace,  
sleep in heavenly peace.  

Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight.  
Glories stream from heaven afar,  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!  
Christ, the Saviour is born,  
Christ, the Saviour is born.  

## [Away in the manger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnwO_0DrpCk)

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
the little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,  
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.  

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
but little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from  
the sky and stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.  

## [Go tell it on the mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsX3tYbai1Q)

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

While shepherds kept their watching  
Oâ€™er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  

The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed our saviour's birth  

And I said GO,  

Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born
