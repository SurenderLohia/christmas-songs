# Christmas Songs...

## Joy to the world

Joy to the world! The Lord is come!  
Let earth receive her King;  
Let every heart prepare Him room,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven and nature sing,  
And heaven, and heaven, and nature sing.  

Joy to the Earth! The Saviour reigns!  
Let men their songs employ;  
While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat the sounding joy,  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.  


## Jingle Bells

Dashing through the snow,  
in a one-horse open sleigh.  
O 'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.  
Bells on bob-tails ring,  
making spirits bright.  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
a sleighing song tonight, oh!  

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
in a one-horse open sleigh, hey!  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh!  

Now the ground is white, go it while you 're young.  
Take the girls tonight, sing this sleighing song.  
Get a bob-tailed bay,  
two-forty for his speed,  
and hitch him to an open sleigh  
and you will take the lead, oh!  

## Silent Night

Silent night, holy night,  
all is calm, all is bright.  
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child,  
Holy infant so tender and mild.  
Sleep in heavenly peace,  
sleep in heavenly peace.  

Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight.  
Glories stream from heaven afar,  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!  
Christ, the Saviour is born,  
Christ, the Saviour is born.  

## Away in the manager

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed,  
the little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head.  
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay,  
the little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay.  

The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes,  
but little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.  
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from  
the sky and stay by my cradle till morning is nigh.  

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay.  
Close by me forever and love me, I pray.  
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care  
and take us to heaven to live with Thee there.
